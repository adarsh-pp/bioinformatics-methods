# Converting BAM to FastQ Files

### Using [bazam](https://github.com/ssadedin/bazam) and [BBMap Suite](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmap-guide/)

#### Converting bam to an interleaved FASTQ format using Bazam
```
java -jar bazam.jar -bam input.bam > output.fastq
```
An interleaved FASTQ file is a type of FASTQ file that contains both the forward and reverse reads of a paired-end fragment in a single file.

#### Spliting the single FastQ file into Read1 and Read2

```
bash /bbmap/reformat.sh in=original.fq out1=R1.fq out2=R2.fq
```

These generated files can then be compressed.

### Using SAMtools and Bedtools

#### Sorting the BAM file

```
samtools sort -n input.bam -o input_sorted.bam   # sort reads by identifier-name (-n)
```

#### Generating read one and read two fastq files from the sorted BAM

```
bedtools bamtofastq -i input_sorted.bam -fq output_r1.fastq -fq2 output_r2.fastq
```
